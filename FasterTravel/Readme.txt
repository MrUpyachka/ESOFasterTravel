ESOFasterTravel v1.3.6
By XanDDemoX

FasterTravel adds two new tabs to the default world map information/navigation control and suggests approximately the closest known wayshrines to your current quest objectives.

Wayshrines
Displays the closest known wayshrine to your quests by marking them with the quest's icon from the map (when it is possible to obtain the data ).
Displays quest objective tooltips when the mouse is over quest icons.
Fast travel to or recall a recently used wayshrine
Fast travel to or recall a wayshrine in the current zone
Fast travel to or recall a wayshrine in another zone
All fast travels and recalls use the appropriate standard confirmation dialog.

Players

Teleport to players on your friends list
Teleport to zones using players on your friends list, in your group or guild
Teleport to players in your any of your guilds
